In order to build and use this sample you have obtain your own copy of the Z3 binaries. Specifically, you need the following:

Microsoft.Z3.dll
libz3.dll

You can get these from http://z3.codeplex.com/releases. 

This sample expects the 64-bit binaries, but can be easily modified to work with 32-bit binaries instead.
